# Heart-Disease-Predictor
The project consists of:
- A machine learning model built using Keras that predicts heart disease.
- A Flask web application that provides a game-like interactive interface for user input.
- Data analysis and visualizations created with Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to uncover insights from the dataset.

How the application works:

The user inputs there data based on the questions asked. Once finished the user clicks the "predict" button and the machine learning model predicts if you have heart disease using artifical nerual networks (ANN).
