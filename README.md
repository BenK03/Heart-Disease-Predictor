# Heart-Disease-Predictor
The project consists of:
- Heart Disease Prediction System is developed using the deep learning Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm for predicting the risk level of heart disease.
- The system uses 13 medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity for prediction.
- ETL processes were used via Pandas for testing model accuracy.
- A Flask web application that provides an interactive interface for user input.
- Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Jupyter Notebook data_analysis.ipynb.
- Data analysis and visualizations created with Python libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).

This model has a 85% accuracy score.

The original data came from the Cleveland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

Model Deployment:  
  - A trained Keras model heart_model.keras and scaler scaler.pkl are used for predictions.
  - This model uses a ANN algorithm which is an essential tool in deep learning.
